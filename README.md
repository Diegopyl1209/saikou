# **Saikou**

Saikou (最高; Sai-kō) literally means the best in japanese. Well, we would like to say this is the best open source app for anime and manga on Android, but hey, Try it out yourself & judge!

Saikou is crafted based on simplistic yet out-of-state elegancy. Inspired from an app called AnymeX , Saikou is an [Anilist](https://anilist.co/) only client, which also lets you stream & download Anime & Manga.  

**🌟STAR THIS REPOSITORY TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPER AND ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE APPLICATION!🌟**

> NOTE: Please do not attempt to upload Saikou or any of it's forks upon the Playstore or any other Android appstores on the internet. Doing so may infringe their terms and conditions. This may result to legal action or immediate take-down of the app.
